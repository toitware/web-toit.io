# Getting started

This project is built with [gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com) and
[react](https://reactjs.org).

## yarn

`yarn` is used in web projects. To install `yarn`, follow the guide
[here](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/#debian-stable).

Note! You don't need to setup your `PATH` env.var. as described in the guide.

If you haven't installed `node` yet, install `node` from
[nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/en/). Add the node bin directory to your `PATH`
in `$HOME/.profile`

The version of `node` must be >= v12.16.1, i.e. the version of node that comes
with yarn is not the latest.

## Running the development server

Install all dependencies with `yarn install` and start the development gatsby
server with `yarn run develop`.

For all available scripts, look at the `scripts` section in `package.json`.
