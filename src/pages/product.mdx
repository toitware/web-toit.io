#### Toit Language

Toit applications are written in Toit language. Why create a new language?
Because existing languages that can be used on microntrollers are not very good.
C has great performance, but is hard to learn, risky to use, and even simple
functionality takes a long time to build. MicroPython is easy to write, but
performance is so poor that it’s hardly usable. Oh, and it doesn’t really work
like Python.

Toit language is a high-level language that’s made to have a syntax very close
to Python, but built from first principles for microcontrollers. We’ve built a
slick integration with your favorite editor...

A high-level language with similarities to Python/MicroPython but with
approximately ten times the execution speed. Turn it into a positive thing - fun
to work with, get devs excited.

#### Toit Virtual Machine

Your code runs as one or more applications inside the Toit Virtual Machine. This
sandboxes your code, so the worst that can happen from a bug is that your
application crashes.

#### Sandboxing

Enables you to run separate applications and install and uninstall them run-time
without affecting your underlying system.

#### Out-of-the-box drivers

The Toit ecosystem comes with ready-to-use drivers for many of the commonly used
peripherals including GSM modules, sensors, actuators and screens. They can be
accessed directly from Toit using our package manager.

#### Over The Air Updates

Advanced OTA functionalities keep your fleet up-to-date, and changes to
functionality or bug-fixes can safely and easily be rolled out, even on slow and
shaky connections. If connection is lost mid-update, the update simply continues
where it left off.

#### Hardware

Toit runs on the ESP32 chip from Espressif. Why this is a great chip

# Cloud

#### Programmable Fleet

Our comprehensive fleet management gives you both a clear overview, as well as
detailed information about your fleet health. Split your devices into groups and
subgroups and deploy code on a group by group level.

#### End to end encryption

All communication between the device and the cloud is end to end encrypted using
modern public-key encryption.

#### Toit API

Our customers have access to the same APIs that we use internally. Our APIs uses
the gRPC framework. Why that’s great...
