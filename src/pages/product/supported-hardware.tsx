            Toit runs on the ESP32 chip from Espressif. We chose the ESP32 because it offers the best price /
            performance out of all the microcontrollers out there. For $2 or less you get 520 KB RAM, built-in WiFi and
            34 pins for peripherals that you can use in any way you want.
          </p>

          <h1>Peripherals</h1>

          <p>
            Toit supports any peripheral you plug into your ESP32 through the GPIO pins, such as Bosch BME280 and
            Sensirion SHT4x environment sensors, and step and servo motors.
          </p>
          <p>You can connect using hardware accelerated I2C, SPI, PWM or UART protocols.</p>

          <h1>Out-of-the-box drivers</h1>

          <p>
            The Toit ecosystem comes with ready-to-use drivers for many of the commonly used peripherals, including GSM
            modules, sensors and actuators. They can be accessed directly from Toit using our package manager.
          </p>

          <p>
            And donâ€™t worry if the driver for your favorite sensor is not available yet, it&apos;s really easy to write
            your own in the Toit language.
