###### Toit applications are written in the Toit language

# High-level language

Why create a new language? Because existing languages that can be used on
microcontrollers are not very good. C has great performance but it's hard to
learn, risky to use, and even simple functionality takes a long time to build.
MicroPython is easy to write, but performance is so poor that it’s hardly
usable. Oh, and it doesn’t really work like Python.

Toit language is a high-level language that’s made to have a syntax very close
to Python, but built from first principles for microcontrollers. This makes it
at least 20x faster than MicroPython. We’ve also built a slick IDE integration.

### Virtual machine

Your code runs as one or more applications inside the Toit virtual machine. The
virtual machine creates a sandboxed environment for your code, so the worst that
can happen from a bug is that your application crashes. The system keeps
running, and so do your other applications.

### Out-of-the-box drivers

The Toit ecosystem comes with ready-to-use drivers for many of the commonly used
peripherals including GSM modules, sensors and actuators. They can be accessed
directly from Toit using our package manager.

And don’t worry if the driver for your favorite sensor is not available yet.
It’s really easy to write your own in the Toit language.

### Over-the-air updates

Updating your devices over the air is as easy on the Toit platform as it is to
deploy new code to a web app - even on slow and shaky connections. The system
keeps running through the update, and if the connection is lost mid-update, it
simply continues where it left off when connectivity is back.

### CPUs

Toit runs on the ESP32 chip from Espressif. We chose the ESP32 because it offers
the best price / performance out of all the CPUs out there. For $2 or less you
get 512 kB RAM, built-in WiFi, and 34 pins for peripherals that you can use in
any way you want.

You can buy them [here](https://www.digikey.com/en/products/detail/espressif-systems/ESP32-DEVKITC-32D/9356990).
