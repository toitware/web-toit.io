###### Toit applications are written in the Toit language.

# High-level language

Why create a new language? Because existing languages that can be used on
microcontrollers are not very good. C has great performance but it's hard to
learn, risky to use, and even simple functionality takes a long time to build.
MicroPython is easy to write, but performance is so poor that it’s hardly
usable. Oh, and it doesn’t really work like Python.

Toit language is a high-level language that’s made to have a syntax very close
to Python, but built from first principles for microcontrollers. This makes it
at least 20x faster than MicroPython. We’ve also built a slick IDE integration.

###### Modular applications for embedded devices

### Virtual machine

Your code runs as one or more applications inside the Toit virtual machine. The
virtual machine creates a sandboxed environment for your code, so the worst that
can happen from a bug is that your application crashes. The system keeps
running, and so do your other applications.

### Out-of-the-box drivers

The Toit ecosystem comes with ready-to-use drivers for many of the commonly used
peripherals including GSM modules, sensors and actuators. They can be accessed
directly from Toit using our package manager.

### Monitor and service your devices in production

Get full visibility into your device fleet with logs covering connectivity, code
execution, and crash reports. Trace the bug, fix it and redeploy, all within
minutes.

Assign your devices into groups and deploy updates on a group by group basis.

All communication is end-to-end encrypted using modern public-key cryptography.
The same technology that keeps the internet secure keeps your devices and data
safe.

### Over the air updates

Updating your devices over the air is as easy on the Toit platform as it is to
deploy new code to a web app - even on slow and shaky connections. The system
keeps running through the update, and if the connection is lost mid-update, it
simply continues where it left off when connectivity is back.

### CPUs

Toit runs on the ESP32 chip from Espressif. We chose the ESP32 because it offers
the best price / performance out of all the CPUs out there. For $2 or less you
get 512 kB RAM, built-in WiFi, and 34 pins for peripherals that you can use in
any way you want.

You can buy them [here]().
