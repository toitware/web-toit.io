          <p>
            Microsoft Azure Sphere provides traditional IoT development capabilities on specific ARM-based dev kits,
            while Toit offers a modern development environment that lets you run several memory-isolated apps in
            parallel on ESP32-based devices.
          </p>
          <p>
            With easy onboarding, fleet management capabilities and built-in data pipeline, Toit lets you build a fully
            functional POC within a week.
