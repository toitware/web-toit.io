## Toit FAQ

#### Why Toit?

Toit is revolutionizing the IoT development process. The current state of IoT development has not changed for decades, and our goal 
is to change that paradigm: We turn firmware development into software development, enabling every software developer to become a 
successful IoT software developer.

#### What is Toit?

Toit is an end-to-end IoT software platform. Toit is also a new programming language tailored for embedded devices,
and Toit provides powerful API endpoints such that your data can flow from your devices into your own IoT cloud system.

Toit offers a device dashboard where you can orchestrate and monitor your device fleet, and the Toit cloud allows for easy and flawless 
over-the-air firmware upgrade of your devices, as well as application deployment even if your devices are offline.

#### Why add a virtual machine to an embedded device?

When you install the Toit firmware on your hardware, the Toit virtual machine is installed on top of the operating system. Thereby isolating your 
embedded IoT applications from each other. The Toit virtual machine gives you a robust, resilient, and secure execution environment for your IoT apps.

[Watch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh83qoq0nKU) how
Toit allows you to deploy, update and uninstall three apps, including one that
would crash any other IoT device, on an ESP32 microcontroller with Toit.

#### Which chip models do Toit support?

Toit runs on the [ESP32](https://www.espressif.com/en/products/socs/esp32) chip
from Espressif. We have chosen the ESP32 because it offers the best price and performance
out of all the MCUs out there. For $2 or less you get 520 KB RAM, built-in WiFi,
and 34 pins for peripherals configurable to be used for communication
protocols (SPI, I2C), analog/digital interfacing (ADC/DAC), Ethernet, and much
more. 

The deep-sleep mode of the ESP32 allows for extremely low power usage and
you can run on a couple of AA batteries for years. All this at a price that is a
fraction of that for comparable or even inferior chips.

At the moment, we only support the ESP32 hardware model with 4 MB of flash. 

#### How do my devices communicate with each other using Toit?

Toit offers easy, out-of-the-box device communication using the publish/subscribe pattern. 

Publish/subscribe is an asynchronous messaging service that decouples services that produces messages from the services processing them.

The applications running on your devices can communicate with each other either directly, if they run on the same device, or via the Toit cloud 
if they are installed and running on different devices. 

An application can publish serializable data on a topic which is sent to all subscribers. Another application can then subscribe to the same 
topic to receive the published data.

All this can be achived with only few lines of code in your applications.

#### How do I write my own driver in Toit?

With Toit, you get build-in access to IoT procotols such as I2C and SPI, as well as GPIO support such that you can start writing your drivers
in the Toit programming language. In the Toit documentation, you will learn how to write your own driver and in Github we have published drivers for some
of the commonly used peripherals and more are coming. They can be accessed directly from Toit using our package manager.

If you need help or if you have questions regarding drivers, don't hesitate to ask us either using the public Slack channel
or by writing to developers@toit.io

#### How can I get the device data into my own backend?

All the functionality of the Toit cloud is also available using the Toit APIs
directly. 

Toit offers publicly available APIs, which are designed to make it easy to ingest collected device data into your own IoT backend. 

Toit provides a GRPC API for communicating with the Toit console from your client applicatopn. 
We have example implementations of client applications written in Java, Python and NodeJS.

Toit also offers a Data API where data to be ingested is grouped into two groups: Metrics and Logs.


#### How fast can I get started using Toit on my hardware?

There are only a few steps required to get started wiht Toit. First, you need a Toit account go get started.

Then, provision your hardware, thereby installing the latest released Toit firmware and adding initial WiFi connection settings.

Your hardware will be linked to your Toit account and your are ready to run or deploy Toit code on your hardware via the Toit cloud.

#### How fast is over-the-air firmware updates of my devices?

We have designed the over-the-air firmware updates to only transfer the changes in each update, not the entire bundle. 
If your connection to your hardware is unstable, the update will eventually succeed, so you don't need to worry about the state of your device. 

The same approach is applicable to the over-the-air updates of your apps to your devices.

#### Which types of connectivity do Toit offer?

The ESP32 and Toit offer out-of-the-box WiFi connectivity. It is also possible
to add Cellular connectivity with the operator of your choice, so you are
flexible to choose the best provider for your communications needs.
In the future, we will also provide ethernet connectivity.

#### Why create a new programming language?

Because of the resource constraints on embedded microchips, an IoT computing
platform needs to be tight in order to work.
Previous IoT languages (such as Java SE Embedded and MicroPython) were generated
as a limited version of the corresponding standard language by removing classes
and other tools. At Toit, we wanted to create a high-level language that
would avoid the limitations of the existing languages used in IoT development.
On top of this, the Toit language had to be intuitive to learn and safe to use.

The Toit syntax is similar to Python, but compared to MicroPython, Toitâ€™s execution
is 20 times faster.

With Toit, you use only one language for all logic on your devices, whether it
is the driver for a sensor, or the applications running on the device.

#### Why use Toit over C?

C is a low-level language that allows full access to the system. It's a great
language for operations that require precise memory layouts or interact a lot
with system calls. In fact, we use it, and C++, under the hood.

However, C is harder to program in and requires the developer to focus on things
that a high-level language, like Toit, can take care of. For instance, Toit
comes with a garbage collector which makes dealing with memory much easier. Not
only that, but automatic memory management also avoids many crashes that would
bring down the full system. Toit programs are sandboxed and can't write to
arbitrary memory locations.

Also, Toit is a much younger language and has incorporated lots of the language
lessons that were learned in the meantime. It features classes, interfaces,
named arguments, etc.

Finally, the Toit language comes with high-level libraries that abstract away
the low-level operations. We, the Toit developers, fiddle with C, so that you
don't need to.

#### Why use Toit over MicroPython?

MicroPython is a stripped-down version of Python that was not tailor-made for
IoT. It is high-level, but it does not really behave as Python does, so that the
switch from Python to MicroPython requires adjustments similar to the ones
needed to switch from Python to Toit.

Since Python wasn't designed for embedded systems, it doesn't perform as well in
that task either. Toit programs run typically 20x faster than MicroPython
programs. Furthermore, the memory layout of objects in MicroPython is not as
efficient as the one in Toit, which means that bigger programs (with many heap
objects) are handled better by Toit than by MicroPython.

#### How is Toit different from other IoT platforms?

- **The Toit VM** - Our Virtual Machine completely isolates you from the
  underlying microcontroller and peripherals, and lets you focus on building your
  solution, not battling hardware.

- **Robust sandboxing** - You can update your apps as much as you want without
  affecting the other apps already installed on your devices

- **The Toit Language** - Work in a modern, high-level language with all the
  perks that come with it, but with an execution speed that is an order of
  magnitude faster than MicroPython.

- **Over-The-Air updates** - It does not matter if your device connections are
  slow or intermittent: Don't worry; your code and updates will come through.

- **The Toit API** - Our API is your gateway to your devices and your data. You
  do not spend time setting up and keep the infrastructure running. Just plug into
  our API and start pulling your device data.
