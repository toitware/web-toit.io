            In the last 5 years, microcontrollers have rapidly improved. Previously, they could only run a single
            predefined calculation, now they are powerful enough to process images or run neural networks. They are also
            getting connected to the internet with new cheap and low-powered WiFi and cellular technologies.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>
              Nonetheless, until now, software development for microcontrollers has been stuck in the stone age.
            </strong>{" "}
            Updating software on a microcontroller is risky and hard and a single bug anywhere in your code could break
            your entire device. Because of that, software on microcontrollers is kept at a minimum and all code is
            written before shipping the device, never to be touched again.

            This is unleashing the creativity of software developers building with microcontrollers, letting them create
            groundbreaking products that touch the physical world.
