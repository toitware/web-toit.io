# We are building the software platform for micro&shy;controllers

  </HorizontalBlockItem>
  <HorizontalBlockItem>

Microcontrollers are everywhere. They sit inside most modern industrial
applications and home appliances. A modern car has more than 30, and over 30
billion are sold each year. They cost just a few dollars or less, are the size
of a fingernail, and can run for years on batteries.

The last 5 years, microcontrollers have gone from only being able to run a
single predefined calculation (some still are) to being powerful enough to
process images or run neural networks. And with new cheap and low-powered WiFi
and cellular technologies, they are getting connected to the internet.

Nonetheless, until now, software development for microcontrollers has been stuck
in the stone age. Updating software on a microcontroller is risky and hard, and
a single bug anywhere in your code can break your entire device. Because of
that, software on microcontrollers is kept at a minimum, and all code is written
before shipping the device, never to be touched again.

With our platform, developers can easily implement functionality and
applications while our platform ensures that the device keeps functioning no
matter what. This is unleashing the creativity of software developers on
microcontrollers and is letting them build groundbreaking products that touch
the physical world.

Toit was founded in 2018 by the team of developers that previously built V8 for
Chrome at Google. We work from our office in Aarhus, Denmark or remote, and we
are backed by Creandum, one of Europeâ€™s leading early-stage venture capital
firms.
