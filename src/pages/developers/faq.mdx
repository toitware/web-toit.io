<FaqEntry question="Why Toit?">

Toit is revolutionizing the IoT development process. The current state of IoT development has not changed for decades, and our goal
is to change that paradigm: We turn firmware development into software development, enabling every software developer to become a
successful IoT software developer.

<FaqEntry question="How is Toit different from other IoT platforms?">

- **The Toit VM** - Our Virtual Machine completely isolates you from the
  underlying microcontroller and peripherals, and lets you focus on building your
  solution, not battling hardware.

- **Robust sandboxing** - You can update your apps as much as you want without
  affecting the other apps already installed on your devices

- **The Toit Language** - Work in a modern, high-level language with all the
  perks that come with it, but with an execution speed that is an order of
  magnitude faster than MicroPython.

- **Over-The-Air updates** - It does not matter if your device connections are
  slow or intermittent: Don't worry; your code and updates will come through.

- **The Toit API** - Our API is your gateway to your devices and your data. You
  do not spend time setting up and keep the infrastructure running. Just plug into
  our API and start pulling your device data.

<FaqEntry question="How do my devices communicate with each other using Toit?">

Toit offers easy, out-of-the-box device communication using the publish/subscribe pattern.

Publish/subscribe is an asynchronous messaging service that decouples the services generating messages from the services processing them.

The applications running on your devices can communicate with each other either directly, if they run on the same device, or via the Toit cloud
if they are installed and running on different devices.

An application can publish serializable data on a topic which is sent to all subscribers. Another application can then subscribe to the same
topic to receive the published data.

All this can be achieved with [only a few lines of code](https://docs.toit.io/tutorials/pubsub/pubsubext) in your applications.

</FaqEntry>
<FaqEntry question="How can I get the device data into my own backend?">

Toit offers publicly available APIs, which are designed to make it easy to ingest collected device data into your own IoT backend.

Toit provides a [GRPC API](https://docs.toit.io/apis/api) for communicating with the Toit console from your client application.
We have [example implementations](https://github.com/toitware/api) of client applications written in Java, Python, Dart/Flutter and NodeJS.

Toit also offers high-level APIs for metrics and logs, that are optimized for size.

</FaqEntry>
<FaqEntry question="How fast can I get started using Toit on my hardware?">

There are only a [few steps](https://docs.toit.io/getstarted/quick_start) required to get started with Toit. First, you need a Toit account.

Then, provision your hardware, thereby installing the latest released Toit firmware and adding initial WiFi connection settings.
This step links your hardware to your Toit account.

At this point you can push code to your hardware using over-the-air updates, either by using the web-based Toit console, the Toit CLI, or 
the Visual Studio Code language extension for Toit.

</FaqEntry>
<FaqEntry question="How fast are over-the-air firmware updates of my devices?">

We have designed the over-the-air firmware updates to only transfer the changes in each update, not the entire bundle.
If the connection to your hardware is unstable, the update will eventually succeed, so you don't need to worry about placing Toit devices in areas
with weak WiFi or Cellular connections.

<FaqEntry question="Why add a virtual machine to an embedded device?">

When you install the Toit firmware on your hardware, the Toit virtual machine is installed on top of the operating system.
It isolates the embedded IoT applications from each other and provides a robust, resilient, and secure execution environment.

Toit allows you to deploy, update and uninstall three apps, including one that
would crash any other IoT device, on an ESP32 microcontroller with Toit.

</FaqEntry>
<FaqEntry question="Which chip models does Toit support?">

Toit runs on the [ESP32](https://www.espressif.com/en/products/socs/esp32) chip
from Espressif. We have chosen the ESP32 because it offers the best price and performance
out of all the MCUs out there. For $2 or less you get 520 KB RAM, built-in WiFi,
and 34 pins for peripherals configurable to be used for communication
protocols (SPI, I2C), analog/digital interfacing (ADC/DAC), Ethernet, BLE, and much
more.

The deep-sleep mode of the ESP32 allows for extremely low power usage and
you can run on a couple of AA batteries for years.

</FaqEntry>
<FaqEntry question="How do I write my own driver in Toit?">

With Toit, you get build-in access to embedded protocols such as I2C and SPI, as well as GPIO support, which makes it possible to write drivers directly in the Toit language.
The [documentation](https://docs.toit.io/hardware/drivers/write/sparkfun_joystick) contains a tutorial on how to write new drivers.
Furthermore, the list of already published drivers can be viewed [here](https://docs.toit.io/hardware/drivers/driverslist). 
These are often a good starting point for writing your own driver.

If you need help or have questions regarding drivers, don't hesitate to ask us either using the public [Slack channel](chat.toit.io)
or by writing to developers@toit.io

</FaqEntry>
<FaqEntry question="Which types of connectivity does Toit offer?">

The ESP32 and Toit offer out-of-the-box WiFi and [BLE](https://docs.toit.io/tutorials/ble/basic) connectivity. It is also possible
to add Cellular connectivity with the operator of your choice. 

We're also working on bringing Ethernet support to the platform.

<FaqEntry question="Why create a new programming language?">

Because of the resource constraints on embedded microchips, an IoT computing
platform needs to be tight in order to work.
Previous IoT languages (such as Java SE Embedded and MicroPython) were generated
as a limited version of the corresponding standard language by removing classes
and other tools. With Toit, we wanted to create a high-level language that
would avoid the limitations of the existing languages used in IoT development.
On top of this, the Toit language had to be intuitive to learn and safe to use.

The Toit syntax is similar to Python, but compared to MicroPython, Toitâ€™s execution
is 20 times faster.

With Toit, you use only one language for all logic on your devices, whether it
is the driver for a sensor, or the applications running on the device.

<FaqEntry question="Why use Toit over C?">

C is a low-level language that allows full access to the system. It's a great
language for operations that require precise memory layouts or interact a lot
with system calls. In fact, we use it, and C++, under the hood.

However, C is harder to program in and requires the developer to focus on things
that a high-level language, like Toit, can take care of. For instance, Toit
comes with a garbage collector which makes dealing with memory much easier. Not
only that, but automatic memory management also avoids many crashes that would
bring down the full system. Toit programs are sandboxed and can't write to
arbitrary memory locations.

Also, Toit is a much younger language and has incorporated lots of the language
lessons that were learned in the meantime. It features classes, interfaces,
named arguments, etc.

Finally, the Toit language comes with high-level libraries that abstract away
the low-level operations. We, the Toit developers, fiddle with C, so that you
don't need to.

<FaqEntry question="Why use Toit over MicroPython?">

MicroPython is a stripped-down version of Python that was not tailor-made for
IoT. It is high-level, but it does not really behave as Python does, so the
switch from Python to MicroPython requires adjustments similar to the ones
needed to switch from Python to Toit.

Since Python wasn't designed for embedded systems, it doesn't perform as well in
that task either. Toit programs run typically 20x faster than MicroPython
programs. Furthermore, the memory layout of objects in MicroPython is not as
efficient as the one in Toit, which means that bigger programs (with many heap
objects) are handled better by Toit than by MicroPython.
